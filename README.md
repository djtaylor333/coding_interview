# Background

Most calendar applications provide some kind of "meet with" feature where the user
can input a list of coworkers with whom they want to meet, and the calendar will
output a list of times where all the coworkers are available.

For example, say that we want to schedule a meeting with Jane, John, and Mary on Monday.

- Jane is busy from 9am - 10am, 12pm - 1pm, and 4pm - 5pm.
- John is busy from 9:30am - 11:00am and 3pm - 4pm
- Mary is busy from 3:30pm - 5pm.

Based on that information, our calendar app should tell us that everyone is available:
- 11:00am - 12:00pm
- 1pm - 3pm

We can then schedule a meeting during any of those available times.


# Instructions

Given the data in `events.json` and `users.json`, build a script that displays available times
for a given set of users. For example, your script might be executed like this:

```
python availability.py Maggie,Joe,Jordan
```

and would output something like this:

```
2021-07-05 13:30 - 16:00
2021-07-05 17:00 - 19:00
2021-07-05 20:00 - 21:00

2021-07-06 14:30 - 15:00
2021-07-06 16:00 - 18:00
2021-07-06 19:00 - 19:30
2021-07-06 20:00 - 20:30

2021-07-07 14:00 - 15:00
2021-07-07 16:00 - 16:15
```


For the purposes of this exercise, you should restrict your search between `2021-07-05` and `2021-07-07`,
which are the three days covered in the `events.json` file. You can also assume working hours between
`13:00` and `21:00` UTC, which is 9-5 Eastern (don't worry about any time zone conversion, just work in
UTC). Optionally, you could make your program support configured working hours, but this is not necessary.


## Data files

### `users.json`

A list of users that our system is aware of. You can assume all the names are unique (in the real world, maybe
they would be input as email addresses).

`id`: An integer unique to the user

`name`: The display name of the user - your program should accept these names as input.

### `events.json`

A dataset of all events on the calendars of all our users.

`id`: An integer unique to the event

`user_id`: A foreign key reference to a user

`start_time`: The time the event begins

`end_time`: The time the event ends


# Notes

- Please implement solution using Ruby
- Please provide instructions for execution of your program
- Please include a description of your approach to the problem, as well as any documentation about
  key parts of your code.
- You'll notice that all our events start and end on 15 minute blocks. However, this is not a strict
  requirement. Events may start or end on any minute (for example, you may have an event from 13:26 - 13:54).


## My Instructions

- I have created 3 files. 
1. meeting.rb - this file is the file that triggers the script run. This file can be run by enterring `ruby ./meeting.rb <names of users>`
For example `ruby ./meeting.rb Bob Maggie` would give you a list of days/times when Bob and Maggie are available
2. availability.rb - this files is the main file that the script runs. This does 3 steps; firstly takes the list of inputted users, and looks them up in the users.json file for matching users. Given they match an existing user (it warns if a user inputted is not in the file) it generates a hash of the user to a user id. Secondly, it looks at the events.json file and further generates a hash, by the hour and minute of day of availability, by looking at the schedule and "blocking" out those times. Finally, it outputs the remaining times in the hash that are deemed available on the users inputted and matches the matching times.
3. availability_spec.rb - this file is the set of tests I wrote for the Availability class, from a TDD perspective.
